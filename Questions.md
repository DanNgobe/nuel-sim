# Research Questions for N-Player Standoff Games üéØ

This document outlines key research questions that can be explored using the Nuel Simulation framework. These questions span game theory, multi-agent learning, information theory, and strategic decision-making.

## üîç Core Research Areas

### 1. **Information Asymmetry and Abstention Behavior**

#### Primary Questions:
- **Q1.1**: Are players more likely to abstain when they have imperfect information about opponent accuracies?
- **Q1.2**: How does the abstention rate change as information quality decreases?
- **Q1.3**: What is the optimal abstention threshold under different information conditions?

#### Experimental Design:
```bash
# Test different observation models
python -m scripts.evaluate --episodes 5000 --strategy DQNStrategy --output ./abstention_study
# Compare: BayesianAbstentionObservation vs SimpleIdObservation
```

#### Metrics to Analyze:
- Abstention frequency by information quality
- Win rates with vs without abstention
- Belief accuracy correlation with abstention decisions

### 2. **Positional Advantage in Sequential Games**

#### Primary Questions:
- **Q2.1**: How does positional advantage in sequential gameplay change with imperfect information?
- **Q2.2**: Is the "first-mover advantage" preserved under uncertainty?
- **Q2.3**: How do players adapt their strategies based on turn order when information is limited?

#### Experimental Design:
```bash
# Sequential gameplay analysis
python -m scripts.evaluate --episodes 10000 --strategy PPOStrategy --output ./sequential_study
# Vary: Turn order, observation models, player counts
```

#### Metrics to Analyze:
- Win rate by turn position
- Targeting pattern changes across positions
- Information utilization efficiency by position

### 3. **Observation Quality vs Strategic Performance**

#### Primary Questions:
- **Q3.1**: How do optimal strategies change as you vary the amount and quality of observations?
- **Q3.2**: What is the minimum information threshold for effective strategic play?
- **Q3.3**: How does observation model complexity affect learning convergence in MARL?

#### Experimental Design:
```bash
# Compare observation models
python -m dqn_marl.train --episodes 20000 --plot --evaluate
# Test: ThreatLevel, Bayesian, BayesianAbstention, SimpleId models
```

#### Metrics to Analyze:
- Training convergence speed by observation type
- Final performance by information complexity
- Robustness to observation noise

```

### 9. **Psychological and Behavioral Factors**

#### Questions:
